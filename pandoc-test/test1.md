### Introduction: What is non-response in a survey?

" The proportion of people among those invited to participate in a non-compulsory interview survey, or other study, who choose not to take part or are unobtainable for other reasons. "  Scott, J. and Marshall, G. *A Dictionary of Sociology* , Oxford University Press, 2009.

In this study, we do not include the subjects who could not be reached:


## Introduction

### Introduction: Issues with high non-response rates

### Introduction: How to increase response rate

- survey design;

- survey administration;

- incentives (individual vs. collective).

### Introduction: Incentives’ administration

- An individual reward is awarded to an individual when he responds to the survey;

- A collective reward is awarded to a group of respondents if and only if the number of respondents exceeds a certain threshold.

### Introduction: Research Question

- "Is collective reward more effective than individual reward in increasing participation and quality of response"?

- Literature on donations: *Contingent Match Incentives Increase Donations* (Anik et al., 2014)

## Experimental Design

### Experimental Design: Survey and Surveyed

- Survey on bicycle theft conducted via email among Tilburg University members;

- Subjects recruited from staff, faculty, student body and alumni using the addresses available to any University member on gmail;

### Experimental Design: Incentives

Incentive = access to a lottery for a prize of 15 euros.

Three different ways to administer the reward:

1. Collective incentive with 25% threshold;

2.Collective incentive with 25% threshold;

3.Individual incentive to the lottery without threshold.

#### Treatment

Two treatment groups:

- low threshold group;

- high threshold group.

####Control

One control group in which anyone who responded to the survey had access to the lottery;

### Experimental Design: Approach

- Power calculation;

- Random sampling;

- Email reminders.

### Technical problem

Angry email from IT staff

## Results and Discussion

### Results

Group        Emails sent      Emails received          Respondents
------------ ---------------- ----------------------- -------------------
$25\%$             900                    887                        98	
$75\%$               0                      0                         0
Individual         900                    885                       100


### Discussion: Why did 25% threshold not have any effects?


- Low thresholds are not sufficient to create significant difference on the response rate.


- Collective/Threshold rewarding may be not as effective in survey setting as in others.


### Discussion: Why was the response rate so low?


- Emailing seems to be an inefficient communication method;


- No reminder was sent (due to unexpected problems);


- Choice of lottery as reward and a not-sufficiently-high prize due to budget limitations


## Policy Advice

###Policy Advice: Design Issues

- Level of Threshold (25%, 50%,100% etc.);


- Type and Size of Reward (Cash, lottery, gift card etc.);


- Means of Communication and Wording;

###Policy Advice: Possible Solutions

We recommend the use of contingent matching incentives to the company, but
with the following conditions:


- Use of a higher threshold, ideally 75% as shown in the literature (75%-Threshold provides sufficient social proof and is a plausible level to reach);


- Cash payment instead of lottery of other alternatives or lottery with a higher amount;


- Traditional mailing or telephone interviews instead of email to communicate the survey to the people (or a
combination of the above);


- Reminders or Survey “advertisement”;


- Wording & structure of the mail should be dealt with attention to make sure people read
 and understand the threshold mechanism.

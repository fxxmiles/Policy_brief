<p>&quot; The proportion of people among those invited to participate in a non-compulsory interview survey, or other study, who choose not to take part or are unobtainable for other reasons. &quot; Scott, J. and Marshall, G. <em>A Dictionary of Sociology</em> , Oxford University Press, 2009.</p>
<p>In this study, we do not include the subjects who could not be reached:</p>

<p>Incentive = access to a lottery for a prize of 15 euros.</p>
<p>Three different ways to administer the reward:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Collective incentive with 25% threshold;</li>
</ol>
<p>2.Collective incentive with 25% threshold;</p>
<p>3.Individual incentive to the lottery without threshold.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Low thresholds are not sufficient to create significant difference on the response rate.</p></li>
<li><p>Collective/Threshold rewarding may be not as effective in survey setting as in others.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Emailing seems to be an inefficient communication method;</p></li>
<li><p>No reminder was sent (due to unexpected problems);</p></li>
<li><p>Choice of lottery as reward and a not-sufficiently-high prize due to budget limitations</p></li>

<h3 id="policy-advice-possible-solutions">Policy Advice: Possible Solutions</h3>
<p>We recommend the use of contingent matching incentives to the company, but with the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use of a higher threshold, ideally 75% as shown in the literature (75%-Threshold provides sufficient social proof and is a plausible level to reach);</p></li>
<li><p>Cash payment instead of lottery of other alternatives or lottery with a higher amount;</p></li>
<li><p>Traditional mailing or telephone interviews instead of email to communicate the survey to the people (or a combination of the above);</p></li>
<li><p>Reminders or Survey “advertisement”;</p></li>
<li><p>Wording &amp; structure of the mail should be dealt with attention to make sure people read and understand the threshold mechanism.</p></li>
